# The Story of This Project

Hello to everyone who reads this. In this short introduction, I want to
share how I arrived at this point. My path was not a straight one; it
was filled with questions, experiments, and revelations. I am not a
scientist. I have no Ph.D., no lab, no background in a research
institute. I am just an ordinary person who became curious. A simple,
thinking person who couldn't be satisfied with things just being the
way they are.

From a young age, a deep, inexplicable, yet very powerful compulsion
formed within me to understand one of humanity's oldest philosophical
questions: **why is there something, rather than nothing?** This became
the driving force that led me here.

After this question was born, I first sought answers in spirituality. I
delved deep: for years, I studied, learned, and researched. Ultimately,
however, I had to realize that spirituality does not provide real answers, only
ones based on faith. For me, that was not enough. So I moved on and began to
search for the solution in science.

I soon realized that here, I could find real answers. My learning
escalated almost to an obsession, I reached for everything where I could
find information that brought me closer to understanding. Books, YouTube,
podcasts, publications, studies, and eventually, artificial intelligence. I
learned about everything: physics, chemistry, quantum mechanics, biology,
evolution, cosmology. I simply admire the world's scientists and am
incredibly grateful for their work. I have gained an unbelievable
understanding of the world through them. Thank you.

So, this inner compulsion has been going on for nearly a decade, and during
this time, a worldview of my own has slowly but surely taken shape within me.

The answer to how I got here is that before I started this whole project,
the recurring thought that occupied me for weeks—even months—was String
Theory and its connection to the grand unification attempts in physics.
String Theory posits that quantum mechanics and relativity could be
mathematically reconciled by introducing 11 dimensions and a new particle.

Somehow, this didn't seem logical to me. I know it's mathematically
beautiful, but what if it doesn't belong to our world? This raised a few
questions in my mind: What if these two worlds don't need to be
connected at all? What if we are talking about two separate systems that
are not mathematically linked on their own, but are necessary *together*
for the universe to exist? Perhaps the laws are the way they are because
that's how everything can function, but that doesn't mean they must
converge mathematically at all costs.

Then another question arose: how do the laws of physics come into being?
The current physical view is that the laws have always existed. But I
thought that the laws themselves must have had to form somehow.

And one day, a thought came: what if something influences the formation of
the laws? My first idea was **consciousness**. I thought that consciousness
affects quantum states, and thus the universe could consciously prefer
laws that lead toward complexity.

This is how my first equation was born. I took the probabilistic 
foundation of quantum mechanics, the Born rule, and modified it with a 
function for consciousness:

$$
P′(ψ) = P(ψ) · f(Φ)
$$

Here, I interpreted f(Φ) as a "consciousness field." This was the equation
that set me on this research path. The first question, of course, was
immediate: how do I define the consciousness field? I concluded that the
consciousness field Φ is a non-local informational background field that,
by acting on quantum systems, supports the creation of low entropy,
high-coherence structures through preferential probability distortion. In
other words, I gave the consciousness field a directionality.

I started simulating it in Wolfram Mathematica, and it worked. It began to
explain physical phenomena. It worked so well that at first, I thought there
must be a mistake. So I started testing it: I made it unstable, introduced
feedback, collapsed it—but it worked in every case.

Then I got to the point where I tried to simulate the beginning of the
universe. At first, it failed, every universe became unstable (perhaps
because there was no E). So I started using RL agents, and the first
universes without laws were born.

A friend then remarked that the consciousness field is also a new
dimension. I had known this, but hadn't dwelt on it. At that moment,
however, I realized: this is not right. It can't be a new dimension.
How could we ever prove a new dimension? I told myself: this is not possible.

I thought about this for days, until I finally concluded: what if
consciousness is *in* energy? What if consciousness originates from there?

Thus, my second equation was born:

$$
P′(ψ) = P(ψ) · f(E,Φ)
$$

Here, I connected energy and consciousness in a common function. The
definition of consciousness, however, remained "directionality"—but more on
that later.

As soon as I wrote down this equation and modified the simulations,
something strange happened: the universes became stable even without RL
agents. It was as if the energy, now endowed with consciousness,
intrinsically preferred the laws that lead to stability—but only within a
narrow range, a so-called "Goldilocks zone," under strict settings.

This prompted more detailed research. As I progressed, one day I came
across the work of a young researcher, Eszter Papp, and her department
head, Gábor Vattay. The researchers at ELTE TTK claim that some of the
proteins that build and operate living organisms exist on the border of
order and disorder, in a quantum critical state. This forms a transition
between electrical conductors and insulators, which can accelerate and
make biochemical reactions more efficient.

Perhaps this was the point that had already started in my subconscious and,
a few days later, brought a confession to the surface: the universe does
not need consciousness o come into existence. **Consciousness does not play a
role in the beginning**—it only emerges later through the complexity of matter.

This realization led me to believe that energy has an internal
directionality that drives it toward complexity. We may not be able to
measure this directly, but if we look for evidence, we can find traces of
it on a large scale. And thus, a universe like the one we know today can
come into being without any creator or consciousness.

And so, the final equation of TQE was born:

$$$
P′(ψ) = P(ψ) · f(E, I)
$$$

Now, I would like to tell you how I was able to develop such a theory
without any university or research background, alongside my job, from my
room, on a single laptop. During my research, I not only studied and
researched physics itself, but also how real scientists work. What they
test with, what they calculate with, what they simulate with. I slowly
found all the necessary tools and methods that were needed for this work
to succeed.

I tried to leverage everything the world wide web made available to me to
get the most accurate and error-free results possible. Thus, I created a
virtual laboratory where I used several AIs as research colleagues—primarily
to minimize error. I used Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, and an offline DeepSeek
to help process publications, write code, and develop the theory. The
mathematical calculations were validated by Wolfram. As a final step of 
validation, knowledge discovery tools like IBM Watson were used to perform 
a deep semantic analysis against the existing scientific literature. 
This ensured the work was properly contextualized and compared to prior art.

Yet, despite this extensive process of creation and validation, the
fundamental doubt remains—as it should in any true scientific endeavor.
In reality, I do not know if this model is "right." I only know that it is a
logically consistent exploration born from first principles. I strove to do
the work as professionally as possible so that it would stand its ground
in the world of science. But I know that real scientists are also
needed—those who, with their professional experience and knowledge, can add
real assertions to this research. My journey has led me to this point; from
here on, collaborative work is needed for this thought to truly become a
part of science.

### A Final Thought: The Next Question
This entire journey has completely changed how I think about consciousness. For a long time, I thought it might be a supernatural phenomenon. But this research, and especially the insight from Eszter Papp's study on quantum criticality in proteins, sparked a new hypothesis in me.

What if the brain itself is a kind of "quantum-organizing" device? What if this incredibly complex system is capable of taking the chaotic sea of quantum possibilities, the superposition of states, and collapsing it into a single, ordered, classical output? And what if that output is what we experience as a thought, an emotion, or consciousness itself?

I realized it's the same "order from chaos" principle as my TQE theory, just at a different scale. My model describes how the universe can stabilize from a sea of possibilities. This new thought suggests how a single thought can stabilize from the quantum possibilities within our brain.

In this view, consciousness is no longer supernatural. It's a natural phenomenon, deeply rooted in the same quantum physics that my work suggests gives rise to the universe itself. This is the next question, the next path to explore.
