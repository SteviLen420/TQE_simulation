# Theory of The Question of Existance (TQE) Framework
A Monte Carlo pipeline for simulating emergent physical laws and cosmological observables from first principles of energy and information.


## About The Project

The TQE Framework is a computational pipeline designed to investigate the hypothesis that the fundamental laws of physics emerge from a primitive interplay of Energy (E) and Information (I). It provides a complete, end-to-end environment for conducting Monte Carlo simulations of universe ensembles, analyzing their cosmological properties, and using Explainable AI (XAI) to uncover the underlying principles.

This repository contains the full source code and documentation for the framework.

## Navigating This Repository

To understand the project, we recommend exploring the following files:

➡️ [STORY](STORY.md) : Start here for the scientific motivation, the core concepts, and the narrative behind the TQE framework. This explains the "WHY" of the project.

➡️ [README](README.md) : This is the main technical documentation. It contains detailed instructions on installation, configuration, usage, and the complete API reference. This explains the "HOW" of the project.

## Quick Start

To get the code up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:sh
   git clone https://github.com/SteviLen420/TQE_simulation/blob/main/TQE_Universe_Simulation_Full_Pipeline/TQE_Universe_Simulation_Full_Pipeline.py

2. Navigate to the main pipeline directory:
```bash
cd TQE_Universe_Simulation_Full_Pipeline
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For detailed execution and configuration instructions, please refer to the(./TQE_Universe_simulation_Full_Pipeline/README.md).
