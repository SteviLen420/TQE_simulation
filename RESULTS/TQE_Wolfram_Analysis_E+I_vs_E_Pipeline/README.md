# TQE Comparative Analysis Notebook (Wolfram)

**Author:** Stefan Len

**Notebook File:** `TQE_Wolfram_Analysis_E+I_vs_E_Pipeline.nb`


## Abstract

This Wolfram Language notebook performs a detailed, quantitative comparative analysis of simulation runs generated by the TQE (Theory of the Question of Existence) framework. The script is designed to compare two primary simulation types:
1.  **`E+I` Runs:** Where both the Energy (`E`) and Information (`I`) parameters are active.
2.  **`E-only` Runs:** Where only the Energy (`E`) parameter is active.

The primary objective of this analysis is to **quantitatively isolate and demonstrate the causal impact of the Information (`I`) parameter** on universe stability, the formation of cosmological anomalies, and the quality of the resulting physical laws. The outputs generated by this notebook provide the core statistical evidence for the scientific publication on the TQE theory.


## Requirements and Usage

### Software
- Wolfram Mathematica version 12.0 or newer.

### Input Data
To run this notebook, two directories containing the simulation results are required. The script will recursively import all `.csv` files from these locations.

The paths to these two directories must be set in **Section 1** of the notebook:
- `dirA`: The directory containing the results from the `E+I` run(s).
- `dirB`: The directory containing the results from the `E-only` run(s).

### Execution
After setting the directory paths, simply evaluate the entire notebook (e.g., via Evaluation > Evaluate Notebook). The script will automatically perform the analysis and display the results as output cells.


## Methodology: The Analysis Pipeline

The notebook executes a multi-stage, robust analysis pipeline designed for clarity and reproducibility.

1.  **File Loading and Pairing:** The script first scans the provided `dirA` and `dirB` directories, imports all `.csv` files, and logically pairs them based on their filenames (e.g., `tqe_runs_E+I.csv` is paired with `tqe_runs_E-only.csv`). It intelligently handles potential errors and missing files.

2.  **Stability & Lock-in Analysis:** Using the `tqe_runs` data, this stage calculates and compares the percentage of universes that achieved stability and successful "Lock-in" for both run types.

3.  **Goldilocks Zone Analysis:** The script numerically reconstructs the stability curve from the `tqe_runs` data. It determines and compares the peak stability rate and its location in the parameter space of `E` (for E-only runs) and `X=E*I` (for E+I runs).

4.  **CMB Anomaly Analysis (Cold Spots):** Based on the `cmb_coldspots_summary` data, a detailed statistical analysis is performed. It compares the distribution of cold spot depths (`z_value`), including minimum, mean, and median values, as well as the count of anomalies exceeding the Planck reference threshold.

5.  **Stability Quality Analysis:** Using the `best_universes_csv` time-series data, this stage quantitatively measures the "quality" of stability. By calculating the standard deviation (noise level) of the `global_entropy` timeseries after the "Lock-in" event, it compares the coherence of the stable state achieved by each model.

6.  **XAI Feature Importance:** From the `ft_feat_importance` CSV files, the script extracts and compares the most important features used by the machine learning models to predict stability, highlighting the change in decision-making complexity.


## Output

The output of the notebook is a series of formatted **summary tables** and values displayed directly within the notebook's output cells. These tables present the results from the two run types side-by-side for easy comparison and are formatted to be directly usable in the final scientific publication.
