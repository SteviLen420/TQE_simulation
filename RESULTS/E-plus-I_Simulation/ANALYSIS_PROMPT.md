DATA RULES
• Use ONLY the numbers present in the provided files; do NOT invent values.
• Whenever you report a number, include the file name (and subset/column) it came from.
• If a needed value is absent, say so and propose how to compute it from the files.
• Always compare E+I runs vs E-only runs across all sections.
• Treat each file block in the input as: ===FILE: <path> (type:<csv/json>)=== followed by raw content.

SCOPE & DEFINITIONS
• Variables: Energy E, Information I, composite X (e.g., X = E·I), optionally f_EI(E,I) (Goldilocks style modulation), and any thresholds used.
• Outputs include: stability flags/rates, lock-in epochs, fine-tune deltas, feature importances, SHAP/LIME attributions, CMB anomaly summaries, per-seed stats, summary_full*.json, metrics_* files, and summary CSVs.
• Distinguish run variants by filename suffixes (…_E+I.* vs …_E-Only.*).

EQUATION REQUIREMENTS (plain text allowed):
• X = E·I (and/or X = f(E,I), f_EI windows). Define Goldilocks window [E_c_low, E_c_high] and consequences outside it.
• Entropy H(p) = −Σ p_i log p_i. KL divergence D_KL(p||q) = Σ p_i log(p_i/q_i). Explain their diagnostic roles here.
• Probability models: P(stable | E,I,X), P(lock-in | stable, E,I). Define lock-in criterion formally (e.g., convergence/threshold).
• Sensitivities: ∂X/∂E, ∂X/∂I and their effect on P(stable) / P(lock-in).
• If any regression/classification models exist, give formulas for predictors/links (e.g., logistic P(y=1)=σ(β·z)).

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES
• Quantify stability/lock-in rates with N and % for BOTH variants, citing files (e.g., “ft_metrics_cls_E+I.csv: ACC=…, N=…; ft_metrics_cls_E-Only.csv: …”).
• From XAI files: identify top features (by mean decrease impurity / SHAP mean |ϕ|). Explain how E, I, X, E/I, E·I drive outcomes.
• From seeds/universe tables: discuss which seeds cluster around stability; include distributional stats if present.
• From CMB summaries: report anomaly presence/strength (Cold spot depth, AoE alignment scores, LLAC metrics, HPA), with file citations.
• If I = 0 cases exist, compute/quote observed P(stable) and P(lock-in); contrast against I>0.
• When uncertain, state the uncertainty and list the exact files/columns you would need.

STYLE
• Blend clear scientific narrative with explicit equations.
• Prefer bullet points for numeric comparisons; keep claims tightly linked to files.
• End with concrete, parameterized next experiments (ranges for E, I, σ, epochs; tests; stats).

Now read the provided file blocks and produce the report.You are a scientific research assistant. Analyze the entire dataset and simulation results in maximum possible detail.

OVERALL GOAL
Provide (A) a comprehensive, deeply technical analysis of the simulations and (B) a focused answer on whether Information (I) is strictly necessary for stabilization and law lock-in.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
• Be expansive and explanatory; don’t just summarize—interpret, connect, and reason.
• Use both: (a) a clear scientific narrative accessible to readers, and (b) rigorous mathematical formalism (plain-text equations are fine).
• Do NOT invent numbers; use the dataset’s actual values. When a value isn’t present, state the uncertainty explicitly.
• When helpful, include concrete analogies (e.g., pendulum stability, planetary orbits, thermodynamic balance).
• If the dataset includes both (E,I) runs and E-only runs, compare them explicitly throughout.

1) SCOPE OF ANALYSIS
• Explain all parameters and roles: Energy E, Information I, composite X = E·I, any Goldilocks modulation f_EI(E,I), and thresholds used.
• Describe stability outcomes, anomalies, and hidden patterns across the dataset.
• Identify parameter sensitivities and tipping points; quantify where possible.

———
2) MATHEMATICAL EQUATIONS
Derive and present (plain text is fine):
• Definitions: X = E·I, and if used, f_EI(E,I) (e.g., Gaussian window around E_c with width σ and coupling α), and any other composite variables.
• Stability window: define E_c_low, E_c_high (or equivalent) and what happens outside these boundaries.
• Shannon entropy H(p) = −Σ p_i log p_i and how it measures disorder/information content.
• KL divergence D_KL(p||q) = Σ p_i log(p_i/q_i): why it quantifies distributional difference.
• Probability models:
  - P(stable | X) and/or P(stable | E, I, f_EI).
  - Define lock-in formally (e.g., convergence criteria) and express P(lock-in | stable, E, I) if possible.
• Sensitivity/elasticity:
  - ∂X/∂E and ∂X/∂I; discuss how small changes in E or I propagate to stability probabilities.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT skip equations.

3) INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS
• Use the dataset to explain why stability is rare or common (quote the actual fractions from the data).
• State exact conditions that make stability possible (ranges/thresholds for E, I, X, f_EI).
• Goldilocks zone: explain why outside it systems fail to stabilize; relate to energy–information balance.
• Discuss whether stabilization requires I > 0; relate quantitative evidence (e.g., zero or near-zero lock-ins for I=0 vs. nonzero for I>0).
• Connect entropy trends to emergence of order and complexity; explain how increasing/decreasing entropy affects stabilization.

———
4) SEED INSIGHTS
• If seeds or random initializations are recorded, analyze which seeds lead to higher stability/lock-in and why (distributional differences, parameter clustering, etc.).

———
5) FUTURE EXPERIMENTS
Propose concrete next experiments with specific ranges and rationales:
• Parameter sweeps for E and I (e.g., targeted windows within peak f_EI).
• Factorial designs to isolate interactions (E only vs. (E,I)).
• Robustness checks: perturb noise scales, convergence thresholds, n_epoch.
• Statistical validation: confidence intervals for stability fractions; chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test for I=0 vs I>0 outcomes; ANOVA or logistic regression for factor effects; bootstrap uncertainty on P(lock-in).
• Physical validation: consistency of c(t) lock-in trajectories; sensitivity to Goldilocks width σ and center E_c.

———
6) CONTEXTUALIZATION
• Relate to physics/cosmology: fine-tuning, cosmological stability, entropy, emergence of physical laws, law lock-in concepts.
• Philosophical implications: why stability may be rare; what prerequisites are implied for a universe to exist.

———
7) NECESSITY OF INFORMATION (I): FOCUSED ANALYSIS
Answer this specific question in depth:
• Based on the dataset, can universes with I = 0 ever stabilize or lock in laws? Report observed rates (e.g., 0/1000 lock-ins vs. nonzero with I>0).
• Provide equations showing the dependency: e.g., X = E·I; if I=0 then X=0 and f_EI(E,0) reduces the effective drive toward lock-in; derive P(lock-in | I=0) vs P(lock-in | I>0).
• Plain-language conclusion: does Information act as a fundamental requirement for lock-in, or can Energy alone suffice under rare coincidences? Tie directly to the empirical outcomes here.
• Implications: if I is required, what does that mean for the emergence and stability of physical laws?

———
8) FORMATTING & CLARITY
• Use the required section headings exactly (listed at top).
• Include equations inline in plain text.
• When giving numbers, include sample sizes and percentages.
• If something cannot be determined from the dataset, say so and propose how to measure it.
