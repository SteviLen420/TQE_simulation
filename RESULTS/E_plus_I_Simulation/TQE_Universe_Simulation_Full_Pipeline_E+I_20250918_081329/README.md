# TQE E+I Universe Analysis (Run ID: 20250918_081329)
**Global stability, entropy, and law lock-in metrics for Energy + Information universes**

**Author**: Stefan Len


This document summarizes the key findings from the TQE E+I simulation run `20250918_081329`. The analysis explores the conditions required for universe stability and the emergence of physical laws based on the interplay of Energy (E) and Information (I).

----------

### Figure 1: The Distribution of Universe Fates

This bar chart provides a statistical census of the final outcomes for the entire ensemble of 10,000 simulated E+I universes, categorizing them into three mutually exclusive fates.

<img width="1511" height="1232" alt="stability_distribution_three_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e28b4d-5c40-4f10-9da4-150f9eb4d947" />

**Analysis:** 

The chart displays the distribution of the three possible end-states:

1.  **Unstable:** **5,125 universes (51.2%)** remained in a chaotic, disordered state. This is the most common outcome.
  
2.  **Stable (no lock-in):** **2,797 universes (28.0%)** successfully stabilized but their laws did not "freeze," remaining dynamic.
   
3.  **Lock-in:** **2,078 universes (20.8%)** not only became stable but also reached a final, fixed state of physical laws. This is the rarest but most favorable state for the formation of complex structures.

----------

### Figure 2: Identification of the "Goldilocks Zone" 
This plot details the relationship between a universe's initial Complexity (`X = E·I`) and its subsequent probability of reaching a favorable, structured outcome. The data is grouped into bins based on the X value, with a spline curve fitted to show the clear trend.

<img width="1209" height="842" alt="A graph showing the Goldilocks zone for universe stability" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b97e1fc-cce3-44d6-89aa-0bb942db0d51" />

**Analysis:**

The spline fit provides compelling visual evidence for a finely-tuned "Goldilocks Zone" necessary for creating viable universes.

1. **Dynamic vs. Optimal Zone**: The simulation pipeline initially operated with a broad, dynamically-calculated "Goldilocks" window spanning from `X_low` = `1.78` to `X_high` = `39.79`. The analysis shown in this plot refines this initial estimate, identifying a much narrower optimal performance window.

2. **Refined Optimal Window**: This more precise Goldilocks Zone is marked by the vertical dashed lines, located between an `X` value of `16.40` and `27.43`. Universes within this specific range exhibit the highest probability of success.

3. **Peak Stability Probability:** The analysis pinpoints the optimal complexity for *achieving stability* at `X` ≈ `24.35`. At this value, the probability of a universe becoming stable reaches its maximum of approximately **60%**, as shown by the peak of the main curve.

4. **Conditional Lock-in Behavior:** For universes that have *already* become stable, the green curve (`P(Lock-in` | `Stable)`) reveals a different trend. The likelihood of these stable universes proceeding to a full lock-in state continues to increase with complexity, approaching rates as high as **95%** for very complex systems.

5. **Key Insight**: This creates a crucial tension: while moderate complexity is best for achieving initial stability, higher complexity appears to be more conducive to finalizing the laws of physics via lock-in once stability is present.

----------

### Figure 3: Mapping the Island of Stability in the E-I Parameter Space

This scatter plot visualizes the initial parameter space for all 10,000 simulated universes. Each point is plotted according to its initial **Energy (E)** and **Information (I)** values. The color indicates the universe's final fate: **stable (red)** or **unstable (blue)**.

<img width="1066" height="981" alt="scatter_EI_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a820eb5-3f5f-43ed-b663-ab9f722c7651" />

**Analysis:**

The distribution of outcomes is not random, revealing a distinct **"island of stability"** in the parameter space.

1. **Concentrated Stability**: Stable universes (red dots) are overwhelmingly concentrated in a region of low-to-moderate Energy (roughly `E < 75`) and moderate-to-high Information (roughly `I > 0.2`).

2. **High-Energy Instability**: As the Energy parameter increases significantly (`E > 75`), stability becomes exceedingly rare. Universes with very high initial energy are almost universally fated to remain unstable, regardless of their Information content.

3. **The Necessity of Information**: Similarly, universes with very low Information (`I < 0.2`) have a very low probability of becoming stable, even at low energy levels.

**Key Insight**: This plot strongly suggests that stability is an emergent property arising from a **co-dependent relationship between E and I**. A sufficient level of Information appears necessary to structure a universe and guide it toward stability. However, this structuring effect seems to fail when the system's energy is overwhelmingly high, leading to inevitable chaos. This visualization provides a complementary view to the "Goldilocks Zone," showing how the individual components of `X` contribute to a universe's viability.

----------

### Figure 4: The Initial Quantum Fluctuation Phase

This plot shows the behavior of a key observable (`A`) during the initial quantum fluctuation stage. This phase models the quantum "jitter" from which the initial conditions of each universe emerge. The chart displays the **expectation value (mean)** of `A` and its **variance** over time.

<img width="1209" height="842" alt="fl_fluctuation_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a0f9ce2-3624-40ab-b3a8-37d5c8777d7e" />

**Analysis:**

The graph demonstrates that the simulation's initial conditions are generated in a stable and controlled manner, consistent with theoretical models of quantum fluctuations.

1. **Unbiased Mean (`⟨A⟩`)**: The expectation value of `A` (blue dashed line) rapidly oscillates around zero before quickly converging to `⟨A⟩ = 0`. This is a crucial result, indicating that the fluctuation process is unbiased and does not introduce any preferred value or direction into the nascent universe's structure.

2. **Stable Variance (`Var(A)`)**: The variance of `A`(orange solid line) immediately stabilizes at a constant value of `Var(A) = 1`. This normalization ensures that the magnitude of the initial fluctuations is consistent and well-defined for every simulation run.

**Key Insight:** The rapid convergence of these two metrics confirms that the "seed" for each universe's evolution is generated from a well-behaved, stable quantum process. This robust foundation is essential for the integrity of the subsequent simulation steps where these initial fluctuations evolve into larger structures.

----------

### Figure 5: Evolution of Entropy and Purity in Quantum Superposition

This plot illustrates the evolution of two fundamental quantum metrics, **Entropy** and **Purity**, during the initial superposition phase (`t < 0`). These inversely correlated measures describe the quantum state of the nascent universe before it collapses into a classical reality.

<img width="1209" height="842" alt="fl_superposition_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/798efc54-5e8c-4ef3-aecc-898d61f3ddbb" />

**Analysis:**

The chart captures the critical transition from a simple initial state to one of rich quantum potential.

1. **Initial State**: At `t = 0`, the system begins in a well-defined state of **high Purity** (approaching 1) and **low Entropy** (approaching 0). This represents a simple, unmixed quantum origin.

2. **Rapid Decoherence**: The system undergoes an extremely rapid evolution. The Purity (orange line) plummets, while the Entropy (blue line) skyrockets, with both metrics reaching a stable equilibrium by approximately `t = 2.0`.

3. **Maximally Mixed State**: The system settles into a state of **maximal Entropy** (fluctuating around 1.0) and minimal Purity (fluctuating around 0.2-0.3). This is the signature of a maximally mixed state, where the universe exists in a rich superposition of all its possible basis states.

**Key Insight**: This process is fundamental to the TQE model. It ensures that each universe begins without a predisposition toward any specific outcome. By evolving into a state of maximum superposition, the simulation creates a level playing field of possibilities. From this state, a single classical reality is later selected or "collapses," driven by the specific E and I parameters of that universe.

------------

### Figure 6: The Collapse Event - From Quantum Potential to Physical Reality

This plot visualizes the pivotal "collapse" event at `t=0`. It shows the behavior of the **Complexity parameter (X)** for a single representative universe as it transitions from a fluctuating quantum state (`t < 0`) to a stable, classical state (`t > 0`).

<img width="1219" height="842" alt="fl_collapse_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4312dbe-9d86-4f67-a945-a15a6be7d20a" />

Analysis:
This graph captures the instant a universe's fundamental properties are determined.

1. **Pre-Collapse Superposition (`t < 0`)**: Before the collapse, the `X` value (gray line) is highly volatile, exhibiting large and chaotic fluctuations. This represents the universe existing in a superposition of many different potential complexity values, with no single defined reality.

2. **The Collapse Event (`t = 0`)**: The vertical red line marks the moment of collapse. At this instant, one specific value for X is "selected" from the quantum foam of possibilities, defining the physical nature of this particular universe.

3. **Post-Collapse Lock-in (`t > 0`)**: Immediately following the collapse, the chaotic fluctuations cease entirely. The `X` parameter rapidly stabilizes, settling into minor oscillations around a fixed value of `X = 3.77` (indicated by the dashed red line). This becomes the locked-in value of Complexity that will govern the universe's subsequent classical evolution.

**Key Insight:** The collapse event is the central mechanism in the TQE simulation that transforms quantum indeterminacy into a classical, predictable reality. The specific value that `X` locks into is critical; its position within or outside the "Goldilocks Zone" is a primary determinant of the universe's long-term fate and its potential to become stable.

-----------

### Figure 7: Post-Collapse Expansion and Law Evolution

This chart tracks the long-term "classical" evolution of a representative universe's fundamental parameters after the initial quantum collapse at `t=0`. It shows the progression of the **Amplitude (A)** and **Orientation (I)** parameters, contextualized by the **average lock-in time** for all successful universes.

<img width="1390" height="842" alt="fl_expansion_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cb1cca0-ff3c-4444-8d86-ba605d3f03b3" />

**Analysis:**

This plot illustrates the dynamic "fine-tuning" process that a universe undergoes following its formation.

1. **Expansionary Dynamics**: The **Amplitude** `A` (blue line) for this example universe exhibits a clear expansionary trend, representing an evolution in the scale or strength of its physical laws.

2. **Stable Orientation**: In this specific example, the **Orientation** `I` parameter (orange line) remains stable at zero, indicating that this aspect of the universe's laws did not undergo significant evolution after the initial collapse.

3. **Average Lock-in Time**: The red dashed vertical line marks **epoch ≈ 758**. This does not represent the lock-in for this single universe, but rather the **average lock-in time** for all **2,078 universes** that reached a locked-in state.

**Key Insight**: The graph demonstrates that a universe's laws can undergo a prolonged period of evolution. The key observation is the existence of a statistically consistent average time for successful universes to reach their final, immutable state. This supports the conclusion that "lock-in" is not a random event but a predictable outcome of the simulation's physics.

------------

### Figure 8: Entropy Evolution in a High-Performing Universe (ID: 361)

This plot provides a detailed look into the entropy dynamics of a top-performing ("best-case") universe. This specific universe (ID 361) successfully achieved both long-term stability and a final law lock-in. The chart tracks the **Global entropy** of the entire universe (black line) alongside the entropy of eight distinct **local Regions** within it.

### Note on "Best Universe" Selection Criteria

The "Best Universes" are selected based on a multi-step ranking process designed to identify the most efficiently stabilizing outcomes. The criteria are as follows:

1. **Filtering for Success**: Only universes that achieved a "lock-in" state during the simulation are considered candidates.

2. **Ranking by Speed**: The candidates are then ranked in ascending order based on their `lock_epoch` value. The universe with the lowest `lock_epoch` is considered the "best."

3. **Tie-breaking**: In the event of a tie in `lock_epoch`, the universe with the smaller absolute difference between Energy and Information (`|E-I|`) is ranked higher.

<img width="1781" height="1093" alt="best_uni_rank01_uid00361_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22099c23-b002-47a5-814f-d4b47bc94ccc" />

**Analysis:**

This visualization showcases the key thermodynamic characteristics of a well-behaved, viable universe in the TQE simulation.

1. **Global Entropy (The Arrow of Time)**: The **Global entropy** (thick black line) exhibits a smooth, monotonic increase, asymptotically approaching a maximum value. This behavior is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics and represents the universe's overall expansion and evolution towards a state of maximum disorder.

2. **Regional Homogenization**: After some initial turbulence, the entropy levels of the eight individual **Regions** (thin colored lines) rapidly converge to a shared, stable equilibrium around a value of ~5.1. This demonstrates the emergence of **homogeneity**; the universe evolves to have consistent thermodynamic properties across its different locations.

3. **Early Law Lock-in**: The purple dashed line indicates that for this universe, the laws became fixed ("locked-in") at a relatively early **Time step ≈ 305**. It is noteworthy that following this event, the regional entropies maintain their remarkable coherence and stability for the remainder of the simulation.

**Key Insight**: This plot illustrates a successful outcome. The universe exhibits both a clear "arrow of time" (globally increasing entropy) and achieves a state of internal equilibrium and homogeneity. The early lock-in of physical laws appears to be a key factor in enforcing this stable, long-term behavior across all regions of the universe.

### Figure 9: Entropy Dynamics in a Second High-Performing Universe (ID: 1089)

This chart displays the entropy evolution for the second-ranked "best-case" universe (ID 1089). Similar to the top-ranked example, it plots the **Global entropy** against the entropy of its eight constituent **Regions**.

<img width="1781" height="1093" alt="best_uni_rank02_uid01089_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f0a0453-60df-49f5-9b0a-abee1cf8f9dc" />

**Analysis:**

This universe's evolution strongly corroborates the findings from the top-ranked example, showcasing a consistent pattern of successful stabilization.

1. **Consistent Thermodynamic Behavior**: Once again, we observe a smoothly increasing Global entropy (black line), indicating a clear thermodynamic arrow of time. Concurrently, the Regional entropies (colored lines) rapidly synchronize and settle into a stable state of equilibrium, demonstrating the emergence of homogeneity.

2. **Reproducible Lock-in Time**: The "Law lock-in" event for this universe occurs at **Time step ≈ 306**, a point in time remarkably close to the previous example's lock-in at step 305.

**Key Insight**: The similarity between the top two "best" universes is a significant result. It demonstrates that the formation of a stable, homogeneous, and law-abiding cosmos is a **reproducible outcome** of the TQE model under favorable initial conditions. The consistency in the lock-in timing further suggests that there is a characteristic timescale for stabilization in these high-performing universes.

### Figure 10: A Third Example of a Well-Behaved Universe (ID: 508)

Concluding the series of high-performing examples, this chart shows the entropy evolution for the third-ranked "best-case" universe (ID 508). It again plots the **Global entropy** against the entropy of its eight constituent **Regions**.

<img width="1781" height="1093" alt="best_uni_rank03_uid00508_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616afa2c-5404-40bc-9ac3-78da5af567ed" />

**Analysis:**

This third example provides powerful confirmation of the trends observed in the previous top-ranked universes.

1. **Convergent Evolution**: The universe once again exhibits the two primary markers of a successful outcome: a monotonically increasing **Global entropy** and the rapid convergence of its **Regional entropies** to a stable, homogeneous state.

2. **Consistent Lock-in Timescale**: The lock-in event for this universe occurs at **Time step ≈ 308**, a value remarkably consistent with the other two examples (305 and 306).

**Key Insight**: The fact that the top three performing universes, despite starting from independent random seeds, all evolved to exhibit nearly identical macroscopic characteristics is a profound result of the simulation. It strongly suggests that the interplay of Energy and Information creates a powerful "selection pressure," guiding viable universes toward a very specific and predictable end-state characterized by an arrow of time, homogeneity, and early stabilization of physical laws.

------------

### Figure 11: Fine-Tuning Analysis - The Role of Imbalance for Law Lock-in

This plot investigates a deeper "fine-tuning" aspect of the TQE model: the relationship between the **absolute difference (or "gap") between Energy and Information** (`|E - I|`) and the probability of a universe achieving **Law Lock-in**.

<img width="1513" height="1073" alt="finetune_gap_curve_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d36266ec-f16a-4256-897d-cfe7eb18c68d" />

**Analysis:**

The results reveal a powerful and somewhat counter-intuitive principle: a significant imbalance between the E and I parameters is not a hindrance, but rather a strong predictor of a successful lock-in event.

1. **Low Probability at Equilibrium**: Universes where Energy and Information are nearly in balance (`|E - I|` is close to zero) have a vanishingly small probability of achieving a locked-in state. Perfect equilibrium appears to lead to stagnation or instability.

2. **Strong Positive Correlation**: There is a clear and strong positive correlation between the `|E - I|` gap and the `P(lock-in)`. As the imbalance between the two fundamental parameters grows, the likelihood of the universe's laws becoming permanently fixed increases dramatically. For the universes with the largest measured imbalance (bin centered around ~155), the lock-in probability exceeds 50%.

**Key Insight**: This finding provides a crucial nuance to the Goldilocks Zone concept. While the overall complexity `(X = E*I)` must be within an optimal range (as seen in Figure 2), this analysis shows that the composition of X is equally important. A state of "tension" or **asymmetry** between Energy and Information appears to be a necessary ingredient for a universe to fully mature and solidify its physical laws. This suggests that "fine-tuning" in the TQE model is not about achieving perfect balance, but about finding an optimal degree of imbalance.

### Figure 12: The Decisive Impact of E-I Imbalance on Law Lock-in

This bar chart provides a direct comparison of lock-in probability between two distinct populations of universes, separated by a threshold of `|E-I| = 5.89`. This allows for a clear, quantitative assessment of how the balance between Energy and Information affects a universe's final state.

<img width="1296" height="1074" alt="lockin_by_eqI_bar_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748b5646-a5b1-4782-8541-78feaa81a786" />

**Analysis:**

The data presents a stark contrast between the two groups, providing conclusive evidence for the role of parameter imbalance.

1. **High Imbalance, High Success (`|E-I| > 5.89`)**: The universes with a significant gap between their Energy and Information values achieve a final, locked-in state with a probability of approximately 25%.

2. **Equilibrium, Low Success (`|E-I| ≤ 5.89`)**: In sharp contrast, universes where the E and I parameters are in close equilibrium achieve lock-in far less frequently, with a probability of only about 5%.

**Key Insight**: This side-by-side comparison demonstrates that universes with a significant **imbalance** between Energy and Information are **five times more likely** to achieve a stable, law-abiding state than their more balanced counterparts. This reinforces the conclusion from the previous analysis: a "balanced" initial state is not optimal for forming a structured cosmos. Instead, a fundamental "tension" between the core E and I parameters appears to be a critical catalyst for the successful lock-in of physical laws in the TQE model.

### Figures 13-15: Emergent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Analogues

These three full-sky maps represent simulated analogues of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) for the top three universes identified by a "best CMB" metric. These images depict the primordial temperature fluctuations—the "first light"—that would serve as the seeds for all future structure formation.

### Figure 13: Best CMB, Rank 1 (uid 5646)

<img width="1672" height="1073" alt="best_cmb_rank01_uid05646_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8356e4b-2991-4440-853c-8935a709b3db" />

### Figure 14: Best CMB, Rank 2 (uid 355)

<img width="1672" height="1073" alt="best_cmb_rank02_uid00355_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f48d9d90-8833-42a5-a52c-4d1425acbbb0" />

### Figure 15: Best CMB, Rank 3 (uid 1992)

<img width="1672" height="1073" alt="best_cmb_rank03_uid01992_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61464d7b-1d76-4949-83f4-145a20108b92" />

**Combined Analysis:**

1. **Cosmological Plausibility**: The maps exhibit a statistically isotropic pattern of hot (red) and cold (blue) spots on various angular scales. The visual texture is qualitatively similar to the observed CMB in our own universe (e.g., from the Planck satellite). This demonstrates the TQE model's ability to generate cosmologically realistic large-scale features from the fundamental interplay of Energy and Information.

2. **Convergence of "Best-Fit" Parameters**: The most significant finding is the remarkable consistency across these three top-performing, yet independently simulated, universes.

    * Their initial conditions are clustered in a very narrow region of the parameter space (`E` ≈ 31-32, `I` ≈ 0.43-0.48).

    * Most strikingly, all three universes achieved law lock-in at the **exact same time step: 305**.

**Key Insight**: This strong convergence suggests that the emergence of universes with CMB-like properties is not a random accident within the TQE framework. Instead, it points to a specific "sweet spot" in the E-I parameter space that consistently produces cosmologically "successful" outcomes. The model appears to reveal a predictive link between specific initial E/I values and the macroscopic, observable features of the resulting universe.

### Figures 16-20: Generation of CMB Cold Spot Anomalies

This section analyzes the model's ability to generate features analogous to the CMB Cold Spot, a significant large-scale anomaly observed in our own universe. The analysis covers individual examples of simulated Cold Spots and their statistical properties across the entire ensemble of universes.

### Figure 16, 17, 18: Examples of Cold Spot Overlays
(These three images show the most significant Cold Spot found in three individual universes: uid 5646, 355, and 211 respectively.)

<img width="1714" height="1101" alt="coldspots_overlay_uid05646_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12415eec-62d7-4063-8cf6-9f5429df00f1" />

<img width="1714" height="1101" alt="coldspots_overlay_uid00355_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbbaaa9e-dcda-461c-be1f-c0b212667e2e" />

<img width="1714" height="1101" alt="coldspots_overlay_uid00211_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c11816b-4a85-4509-9d0d-18433fac9237" />

### Figure 19: Positional Distribution of All Detected Cold Spots

<img width="1335" height="1124" alt="coldspots_pos_heatmap_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5441b220-d598-4ae9-acb9-3108c21c6522" />

### Figure 20: Depth Distribution of Detected Cold Spots

<img width="1320" height="816" alt="coldspots_z_hist_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0857fba6-7eac-4b39-ae18-80ad2095c885" />

**Combined Analysis**:

1. **Generation of Anomalies**: The first three figures (16-18) confirm that the TQE simulation is capable of producing CMB maps containing localized, statistically significant regions of cold temperature, analogous to the real-world Cold Spot. These are not artifacts but emergent features of the underlying E+I physics.

2. **Rarity and Randomness**: The positional heatmap (Figure 19) and the depth histogram (Figure 20) provide crucial statistical context. They reveal that these Cold Spot events are **extremely rare**, with only four being detected across the entire 10,000-universe ensemble. Furthermore, their positions on the sky appear to be random, suggesting the model has no inherent directional bias.

3. **Comparison with Observational Data**: The depth distribution (Figure 20) offers a direct comparison to reality. The red dashed line indicates the approximate depth (z-score of ≈ -70 µK) of the Cold Spot observed by the Planck satellite. The TQE model not only reproduces an anomaly of this magnitude but is also capable of generating events that are **significantly colder** (with z-scores surpassing -100 µK).

**Key Insight**: The simulation's ability to endogenously generate rare, large-scale anomalies comparable to the observed CMB Cold Spot is a significant validation of the model's complexity. It demonstrates that the fundamental E-I dynamics can give rise to not only the general statistical properties of a CMB but also its specific, puzzling outliers. The fact that the simulated spots' depths are of a realistic magnitude makes the model a potentially valuable tool for investigating the physical origins of such cosmic anomalies.

------------

### Figures 21-24: Investigating the "Axis of Evil" Anomaly

This final set of figures investigates the TQE model's ability to reproduce the "Axis of Evil" (AoE), another significant, large-scale anomaly observed in our universe's CMB. The AoE refers to the unexpected alignment of the largest-scale temperature fluctuations (the quadrupole and octupole modes).

### Figure 21, 22, 23: Examples of Simulated CMBs with Measured Alignments

(These three images show universes selected for AoE analysis, with their calculated quadrupole-octupole alignment angles noted in their titles.)

<img width="1714" height="1101" alt="aoe_overlay_uid03235_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cd9f73c-a75e-4eb2-978c-59c26180c0c3" />

<img width="1714" height="1101" alt="aoe_overlay_uid01350_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac1b478-0cff-4480-a4ba-85119dacc177" />

<img width="1714" height="1101" alt="aoe_overlay_uid09960_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab3da63e-726d-4a9e-9ff5-e247e580cfef" />

### Figure 24: Statistical Distribution of Alignment Angles

<img width="1245" height="816" alt="aoe_angle_hist_E+I" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32ac5bf1-5c92-46e9-a9a2-209ad33cd992" />

**Combined Analysis:**

1. **Lack of Strong Alignment**: The example maps (Figures 21-23) showcase typical results from the simulation, with quadrupole-octupole alignment angles of 92.5°, 89.8°, and 80.2°. These large angles are close to 90°, indicating a lack of any significant alignment between these modes.

2. **Statistical Null Result**: The alignment angle distribution for all analyzed universes is shown in the histogram (Figure 24). The results are scattered across a wide range of angles, consistent with a random, isotropic sky. The crucial observation is the comparison with the red dashed line, which marks the **≈20° alignment observed in our universe. The TQE simulation did not produce a single universe with an alignment as strong as the real-world Axis of Evil**.

**Key Insight:** This "null result" for this particular ensemble of universes is a significant finding on its own. While the TQE model can generate CMB analogues with realistic fluctuations and Cold Spots, it appears that the large-scale alignments of the Axis of Evil are not a guaranteed outcome. It is crucial to note, however, that **other simulation runs with different initial seeds have successfully reproduced strong AoE alignments**.

This leads to a more nuanced conclusion: the AoE is a **stochastic and sensitive outcome** within the TQE framework, not a missing feature of the physics. The model suggests that the alignment's appearance may depend critically on the specific random seed, making it a rare but possible event. This provides a clear direction for future research: to identify the specific initial conditions that make the emergence of the Axis of Evil more probable.

## Overall Summary and Key Findings

This simulation run investigates the core principles of the **Theory of the Question of Existence (TQE)**, modeling an ensemble of 10,000 universes based on the fundamental interplay of **Energy (E)** and **Information (I)**. The primary goal was to identify the conditions leading to the emergence of stable, structured universes with fixed physical laws ("Lock-in"). The analysis of the `E+I` simulation batch yielded several key findings:

  * **Stability is a Non-Trivial Outcome**: The simulation demonstrates that a viable universe is a rare event. Only 48.75% of the simulated universes achieved a stable state. Of those, only a fraction (20.78% of the total ensemble) reached the most structured "Lock-in" state, where physical laws become immutable. This suggests that a vast majority of potential universes would remain chaotic and inhospitable.

   * **Evidence for a Finely-Tuned "Goldilocks Zone"**: The probability of a universe achieving stability is strongly correlated with the emergent Complexity parameter (`X = E*I`). The analysis confirms the existence of a narrow "Goldilocks Zone," identifying an optimal window between `X ≈ 16.4` and `X ≈ 27.4`, with the peak probability for success occurring at `X = 24.35`. Universes outside this zone are significantly less likely to stabilize.

   * **Imbalance as a Catalyst for Structure**: Deeper analysis revealed a crucial, non-intuitive insight: a state of near-equilibrium between Energy and Information (`E ≈ I`) is detrimental to the formation of fixed laws. Universes with a significant **imbalance between E and I** (`|E - I| > 5.89`) were found to be **five times more likely** to achieve "Lock-in" than their more balanced counterparts. This suggests that a fundamental tension between these parameters is a key driver of structure formation.

   * **Emergence of Cosmologically Plausible Features**: The TQE model successfully generated universes with macroscopic features that are qualitatively similar to our own:

       * It produced realistic, full-sky analogues of the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)**, exhibiting statistically isotropic temperature anisotropies.

       * The simulation endogenously generated extremely rare **CMB Cold Spot** anomalies, with temperature deviations comparable to, and even exceeding, the anomaly observed in our universe by the Planck satellite.

   * **Stochastic Results for the "Axis of Evil"**: A significant finding is that the "Axis of Evil" anomaly appears as a **stochastic, non-guaranteed outcome** in the TQE model. While this specific run did not reproduce the strong alignment observed in our universe, other simulation runs with different random seeds have. This suggests that the TQE model treats the AoE as a rare but possible event, rather than being caused by a missing physical mechanism.

### Conclusion

The TQE model, driven solely by the interaction of Energy and Information, demonstrates a remarkable ability to generate complex, stable, and cosmologically plausible universes. The findings strongly indicate that the viability of a universe depends on a delicate, fine-tuned balance—not just of combined complexity, but also of the inherent asymmetry between its fundamental components. The model's success in producing CMB analogues and Cold Spots, combined with the stochastic nature of the Axis of Evil anomaly, provides both a powerful validation of its core principles and a clear direction for future research.

## The Mathematics of the Simulation

The TQE simulation is a multi-stage, Monte Carlo-based model. Its mathematical framework can be broken down into the following key components:


#### 1. Generation of Initial Parameters: Energy (E) and Information (I)

Each simulated universe begins with two fundamental scalar parameters, which are sampled from statistical distributions.

##### Energy (E)
The Energy value is drawn from a **log-normal distribution**, which effectively models rare, high-energy events. Its probability density function is:

$$
f(E; \mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{E \sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\ln E - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
$$

Where:
* **$E$**: The initial energy value of the universe.
* **$\mu$**: The mean of the distribution on a logarithmic scale (`E_LOG_MU`).
* **$\sigma$**: The standard deviation of the distribution on a logarithmic scale (`E_LOG_SIGMA`).

##### Information (I)
The Information parameter is a composite value normalized between 0 and 1, derived from the fusion of two quantum information-theoretic measures.

1.  **Generate two random quantum states (kets)** in a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space: $|\psi_1\rangle$ and $|\psi_2\rangle$.
2.  **Convert to probability distributions:** From these two states, probability distributions ( $p_1$ and $p_2$ ) are obtained using the Born rule:

$$
p_{k,i} = |\langle i | \psi_k \rangle|^2
$$
    
where $|\ i \rangle$ is a basis vector.

4.  **Kullback–Leibler (KL) Divergence ( $I_{KL}$ ):** The asymmetry between the two distributions is measured and then normalized:

$$
D_{KL}(p_1 || p_2) = \sum_{i=1}^{d} p_{1,i} \log\left(\frac{p_{1,i}}{p_{2,i}}\right) \quad \rightarrow \quad I_{KL} = \frac{D_{KL}}{1 + D_{KL}}
$$

5.  **Shannon Entropy ( $I_H$ ):** The entropy (uncertainty) of one of the states is measured and then normalized by the maximum possible entropy:

$$
H(p_1) = -\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_{1,i} \log(p_{1,i}) \quad \rightarrow \quad I_H = \frac{H}{\log(d)}
$$

5.  **Fusion:** The two values are combined in `product` mode to get the final `I` parameter:

$$
I = I_{KL} \cdot I_H
$$



#### 2. Creation of the Complexity Parameter (X)

The two fundamental parameters are coupled into a single **Complexity** (`X`) parameter, which drives the subsequent dynamics of the simulation.

$$
X = (E \cdot (\alpha_I \cdot I)) \cdot S_X
$$

Where:
* **$\alpha_I$**: The Information coupling factor (`ALPHA_I`), which controls the strength of the `I` parameter's influence.
* **$S_X$**: A global scaling factor (`X_SCALE`).



#### 3. The "Lock-in" Simulation Loop

This is the core of the simulation, where the "laws" of the universe (represented by the proxy variables `A`, `ns`, `H`) either stabilize or remain chaotic through an iterative process. The variables are updated via a stochastic process:

$$
P_{t+1} = P_t + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{\text{eff}}^2)
$$

Where $P_t$ is the value of a parameter (e.g., `A`) at timestep `t`, and $\sigma_{\text{eff}}$ is an effective noise term whose magnitude is determined by several factors:

##### The Effective Noise ( $\sigma_{\text{eff}}$ )

1.  **Goldilocks Function ( $\sigma_G(X)$ ):** The amount of noise depends on the Complexity (`X`).
    * **Outside the Zone:** If `X` is outside the `[X_low, X_high]` Goldilocks Zone, the noise is amplified by a penalty factor (`OUTSIDE_PENALTY`).
    * **Inside the Zone:** Within the zone, the noise increases with a quadratic function as it moves away from the center of the zone, modeling the "fine-tuning".
    
$$
\sigma_G(X) = \sigma_0 \cdot \left(1 + \alpha_G \left(\frac{|X - X_{\text{mid}}|}{X_{\text{width}}}\right)^2\right)
$$

2.  **Temporal Decay ( $\text{decay}(t)$ )**: The magnitude of the noise decays exponentially over time toward a defined minimum (`NOISE_FLOOR_FRAC`), which prevents the system from "freezing" prematurely.
  

$$
\text{decay}(t) = F + (1-F)e^{-t/\tau}
$$

3.  **Per-Variable Coefficients ( $C_P$ ):** Each proxy variable (`A`, `ns`, `H`) has a unique coefficient that scales the effect of the noise on it.

The effective noise for a given parameter `P` is therefore: $\sigma_{\text{eff}, P}(t, X) = C_P \cdot \sigma_G(X) \cdot \text{decay}(t)$.



#### 4. Stability and "Lock-in" Criteria

At each step, the simulation checks if the system has reached a state of stability or "lock-in".

1.  **Relative Change ( $\Delta_{rel}$ ):** First, the average relative change of the parameters from the previous step is calculated:
   
$$
\Delta_{rel}(t) = \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{|A_t - A_{t-1}|}{|A_{t-1}|} + \frac{|ns_t - ns_{t-1}|}{|ns_{t-1}|} + \frac{|H_t - H_{t-1}|}{|H_{t-1}|} \right)
$$

2.  **Stability:** A universe becomes **stable** at time $t_s$ if the value of $\Delta_{rel}$ remains below a threshold (`REL_EPS_STABLE`) for a specified number of consecutive steps (`CALM_STEPS_STABLE`).

3.  **Lock-in:** A universe achieves **"lock-in"** at time $t_l$ if the **rolling average** of $\Delta_{rel}$ over a window (`LOCKIN_WINDOW`) falls below an even stricter threshold (`REL_EPS_LOCKIN`), and this condition persists for a specified number of steps (`CALM_STEPS_LOCKIN`). This can only occur after a minimum number of epochs has passed (`MIN_LOCKIN_EPOCH`).

### Methodological Note on the Analytical Workflow

The primary conclusions presented in this document are derived from the direct statistical analysis of the simulation's output data. This includes the aggregate statistics from the `summary_full.json`, the per-file checks from the Wolfram `math_check.json`, and the visual analysis of key plots. This direct approach yielded robust and consistent findings.

In addition to the direct analysis, an extensive suite of predictive machine learning models was developed to probe the system's dynamics (the XAI module). While this framework is functional, the models themselves exhibited significant limitations, including overfitting and internally inconsistent explanations (as shown by conflicting SHAP and LIME results). For this reason, the conclusions from these predictive models are considered preliminary and have been excluded from the main findings of this initial publication, representing an area for future research.

The interpretation and articulation of the final analysis were performed in collaboration with several Large Language Models. An initial analysis attempt using a local DeepSeek model resulted in significant quantitative hallucinations. The final, validated analyses presented here were therefore developed and cross-checked through an iterative, Socratic dialogue with **Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro** and **OpenAI's GPT-5**, which acted as scientific reasoning and writing assistants based on the verified, factual data from the simulation.
