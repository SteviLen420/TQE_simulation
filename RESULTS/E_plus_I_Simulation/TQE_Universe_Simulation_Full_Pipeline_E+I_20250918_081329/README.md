# TQE E+I Universe Analysis (Run ID: 20250918_081329)
**Global stability, entropy, and law lock-in metrics for Energy + Information universes**

**Author**: Stefan Len


This document summarizes the key findings from the TQE E+I simulation run `20250918_081329`. The analysis explores the conditions required for universe stability and the emergence of physical laws based on the interplay of Energy (E) and Information (I).

### Figure 2: The Distribution of Universe Fates

This bar chart provides a statistical census of the final outcomes for the entire ensemble of 10,000 simulated E+I universes, categorizing them into three mutually exclusive fates.

**Analysis:** The chart displays the distribution of the three possible end-states:
1.  **Unstable:** **5,125 universes (51.2%)** remained in a chaotic, disordered state. This is the most common outcome.
2.  **Stable (no lock-in):** **2,797 universes (28.0%)** successfully stabilized but their laws did not "freeze," remaining dynamic.
3.  **Lock-in:** **2,078 universes (20.8%)** not only became stable but also reached a final, fixed state of physical laws. This is the rarest but most favorable state for the formation of complex structures.
