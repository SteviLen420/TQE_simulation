# TQE Simulation Results for E+I Universes
**Author:** Stefan Len

## Important Note: Preliminary Data

Please be aware that the results presented in this directory are **preliminary and not conclusive**.

The data generation pipeline is still under active development, may contain bugs, and requires further refinement. These outputs should be considered **representative**, their primary purpose is to serve as a proof-of-concept demonstrating that the theoretical simulations are operational.

## Directory Structure

This directory contains the complete, raw results from the `TQE_Universe_Simulation` runs, specifically for the **E+I (Energy + Information) universe paradigm**.

These simulations complement the E-Only runs and are essential for the comparative analysis of how Information (I) impacts universal evolution. Each subdirectory named `TQE_Universe_Simulation_Full_Pipeline_E+I` contains the full output of a single, independent simulation run. The timestamp in the directory name (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) indicates the precise execution time.

## Contents of Each Directory

Each simulation folder contains the following file types, documenting different aspects of the run:

* **`CSV files (.csv)`**: Raw numerical data, metrics, and statistics in tabular format.
* **`JSON files (.json)`**: Structured output data, parameters, and summaries in a machine-readable format.
* **`Images (.png)`**: Automatically generated visualizations, such as plots and diagrams, illustrating key findings.
* **`CMB Maps (.fits)`**: Simulated Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps in the standard astronomical `.fits` format. 
* **`Wolfram Mathematica Notebooks (.nb)`**: The complete Wolfram Language analyses used to process and evaluate the data.

The results and conclusions were derived not only through manual evaluation, but also based on a detailed analysis conducted with the assistance of several artificial intelligence models (**OpenAI GPT-5**, **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**, **DeepSeek-R1:14B**).
