# TQE Wolfram Math Check Pipeline

**Author:** Stefan Len

**Notebook File:** `TQE_Wolfram_Math_Check_Pipeline.nb`

## Abstract

This Wolfram Language notebook serves as a data validation and profiling tool for the TQE (Theory of the Question of Existence) simulation framework. Its primary purpose is to perform a rapid statistical "health check" on the raw `.csv` output files generated by a simulation run.

The script iterates through all CSV files in a specified directory, calculates basic descriptive statistics (Mean, Standard Deviation) for all numeric columns, and checks for data integrity issues such as empty files, non-numeric values (NaNs), or infinities.

This pipeline is intended to be used as a preliminary step before conducting the main comparative analysis, ensuring the quality and consistency of the raw data.

## Requirements and Usage

### Software
- Wolfram Mathematica 12.0 or newer.

### Input Data
The script requires a single directory containing all the `.csv` files from a single TQE simulation run.

### Execution
1.  Open the notebook (`TQE_Wolfram_Math_Check_Pipeline.nb`).
2.  In the main execution section, set the `simDir` variable to the absolute path of the directory containing your simulation's CSV files.
3.  Evaluate the entire notebook (e.g., via Evaluation > Evaluate Notebook).

## Methodology: The Analysis Pipeline

The script automates the following data profiling steps:

1.  **Scan Directory:** The script begins by finding all files with a `.csv` extension within the specified `simDir` input directory.

2.  **Iterate and Analyze:** It then processes each discovered CSV file individually using the `analyzeCSV` function.

3.  **Calculated Metrics:** For each file, the following metrics are calculated:
    * **Per File:**
        * `TotalRows`: The total number of rows in the CSV.
        * `AnyNaN`: A boolean flag that is `True` if any non-numeric values are found.
        * `AnyInfinity`: A boolean flag that is `True` if any infinite values are found.
    * **Per Numeric Column:**
        * `Mean`: The arithmetic mean of the column's values.
        * `StdDev`: The standard deviation of the column's values.

## Output

The script generates output in two forms:

1.  **In-Notebook Display:** The final, comprehensive statistical summary for all files is displayed as a `Dataset` table directly within the notebook for immediate review.

2.  **Exported Files:** A new, timestamped folder named `TQE_Math_Check_[timestamp]` is created on the user's Desktop. This folder contains the full analysis results in two standard formats for archival and external use:
    * `math_check_results.csv`
    * `math_check_results.json`
